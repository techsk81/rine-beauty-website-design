# 10 usability points for the system design with respect to multimedia user interface.

1. Text – For the purpose of using text in my website design I have kept it minimal and not
made certain text crowd certain parts. For the text to be readily readable by the user the
position of the page and text has been set to horizontal orientation (wider-than-tall). Also,
the font and font sizes type have been kept consistent according to the measurement of
each text in each line by tracking.

2. Image and Video – The file type for images I have used is png and svg images. Giving a
lossless compression that helps with showcasing the solid colours of the makeup products.
There is more flexibility with the sizing of the images since some are positioned as wide or
tall. For svg images it allows for the images to be scalable and for the images to be
downloadable.

3. Colour – For the colour palette of this website I have kept minimal colours in the shades of
Matterhorn (a dark purple) to lighter shade of the pinks and some nude colours. There are
complimenting and contrasting colours which help the user to look at the important text
when they need to click on the navbar. As well as when there is text to be read the
background colour is light for the text to be visible.

4. Whitespace- A significant amount of whitespace has been used throughout the webstie
design. Necessary whitespace around the text has been included for the groups of text to be
noticed by the user. Also, for the image and video gallery there are borders of whitespace
around each image to make the image visible. Whereas if the images were positioned close
to each other then it would look crowded.

5. Video – One short video clip has been used in the image gallery to emphasize the brand
that the website is presenting. It gives a moving image experience of the rine beauty brand
for promotional purposes. The video does not include any audio since it gives more of the
visual aspect to attract the user’s attention.

6. Non-Linear & User Interactive – The website itself has been made for users to have a
chance to look at the new brand. There is a set of navigational controls for the user to
interact with information about the brand. The user can also sign up for the featured
products or get more information.

7. Accessibility – The website is accessible to any users looking for a new makeup brand. The
controls and the visuals of the website have a perceivable approach. The user intuitively
knows what each button or webpage responds to. Which then showcases the results of
what the user wants to see.

8. Consistency – Throughout the website across all the web pages it presents a consistent
design. The text, colours, images and buttons are similar from one web page to the next
web page. Relatable layouts of the text and images have been used throughout. The navbar
has been kept constant with all web pages since it helps with the correct navigation.

9. Navigation – For navigation purposes it has been kept relatively simple and straightforward.
The structure of the website is presented with a minimalistic approach. The navbar being
the primary navigation has been placed at the top so that the user knows to go back to the
top to navigate to other pages.

10. Learnability & Clarity – When a new user visits this website it will take them a few seconds
to examine what the website is about. The user has come to the website with the aim of
looking for new makeup products. When they see this website, it gives the overall feel of
new makeup products. The colours, text and images do justice to what the website offers.
Simplicity is key here for the design which allows the elements of the design to be accessible
and recognizable by the users.
